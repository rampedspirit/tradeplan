<p>Note: Stream fucntion can ONLY BE USED for indicator's having signal lines by DEFAULT. All indicator line and
    indicator's signal line crossover related queries are addressed by stream function.</p>
<p>3 options are there for stream:</p>
<p>macd indicator has been taken as example to show the usage.</p>
<ul>
    <li>crossover(0,BULLISH): Checks if the macd's signal line at latest closed candle has "crossed above" the macd
        line.</li>
    <li>crossovercount(BULLISH): checks the number of times BULLISH or BEARSIH crossovers has occured between macd line
        and macd signal line in a given period.</li>
    <li>valueAt(0): Gives the value of macd's signal line at latest completed candle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lets Assume that the current date is 24-Aug-2021, time 12:23 PM. Market started at 9:15 AM and ends at 3:30 PM</p>
<ol>
    <li>candle(m,15m,0).macd(9,20,10).stream(100).crossover(0,BULLISH) = 1 : This means,
        <ul>
            <li>"candle(m,5m,0)" : Starting point "m" = 12:23PM, "5m" = Open 5min chart, "0" = Get the Latest OLHCV
                values in 5min chart, i.e all OLHCV values of 12:15 PM's 5 min candle.</li>
            <li>"macd(9,20,9)" : calculates the value of "macd line" for 9 ema and 20 ema period at 12:15 PM's candle.
            </li>
            <li>"stream(100)": using macd line, stream will calculate macd signal line for last 100 period. So, this
                will have 100 macd signal values.</li>
            <li>"crossover(0,BULLISH)" : For collected macd line and macd signal line, at 12:15 PM, this will check if
                macd signal line has made "BULLISH" crossover or not. "1" means crossover has happend and "0" means its
                not crossed. Similarly, for BEARISH crossover can also be checked.</li>
        </ul>
        This code will check if at latest closed candle, a BULLISH crossover of macd line and macd signal line has
        occured or not.
    </li>
    <li>candle(m,15m,0).macd(12,26).stream(100).crossoverCount(BULLISH) > 5 : This means,
        <ul>
            <li>"candle(m,5m,0)" : Starting point "m" = 12:23PM, "5m" = Open 5min chart, "0" = Get the Latest OLHCV
                values in 5min chart, i.e all OLHCV values of 12:15 PM's 5 min candle.</li>
            <li>"macd(9,20,9)" : calculates the value of "macd line" for 9 ema and 20 ema period at 12:15 PM's candle.
            </li>
            <li>"stream(100)": using macd line, stream will calculate macd signal line for last 100 period. So, this
                will have 100 macd signal values.</li>
            <li>"crossoverCount(BULLISH)" : This will count the number of times the BULLISH crossover has occured
                between macd line and macd signal line.</li>
        </ul>
        This code will counts the number of times the macd line and macd signal line has made BULLISH crossovers and
        check if the count is greater than 5 or not.
    </li>
    <li>candle(m,15m,0).macd(12,26).stream(100).valueAt(0) > 100 : This means,
        <ul>
            <li>"candle(m,5m,0)" : Starting point "m" = 12:23PM, "5m" = Open 5min chart, "0" = Get the Latest OLHCV
                values in 5min chart, i.e all OLHCV values of 12:15 PM's 5 min candle.</li>
            <li>"macd(9,20,9)" : calculates the value of "macd line" for 9 ema and 20 ema period at 12:15 PM's candle.
            </li>
            <li>"stream(100)": using macd line, stream will calculate macd signal line for last 100 period. So, this
                will have 100 macd signal values.</li>
            <li>"valueAt(0)" : Gives the macg signal line value at latest closed candle, i.e at 12:15 PM.</li>
        </ul>
        This code will check if the latest macd signal line value is greater than 100 or not.
    </li>
