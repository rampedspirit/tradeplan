<p>Lets Assume that the current date is 24-Aug-2021, time 12:23 PM. Market started at 9:15 AM and ends at 3:30 PM</p>
<p>Note: Volume is always calculated at CLOSE TIME of specified candle. Eg: 12:15 PM has two values in 5 mins chart,
    close value at 12:10 PM candle and open value at 12:15 PM. If volume at 12:15 PM is requestedm it will give volume
    of 12:10 PM's volume, but not the 12:15 PM's volume.</p>
<ol>
    <li>volume(m,5m,0) : Starting point "m" = 12:23PM, "5m" = Open 5min chart, "0" = Get the Latest volume in 5min
        chart, i.e volume of 12:15 PM 5 min candle</li>
    <li>volume(m,5m,-1) : Starting point "m" = 12:23PM, Timeframe/chart = 5m, "-1" = 2nd completly closed candle BEFORE
        12:23PM, i.e Latest closed candle = "0" = 12:15PM candle, one before this candle = "-1" = 12:10 PM candle, So
        volume of 12:10 PM candle.</li>
    <li>volume(h,15m,-2) : volume of 11:30 AM's 15min candle</li>
    <li>volume(h,15m,0) : volume of 12:00 PM's 15min candle</li>
    <li>volume(d,m,0) : volume of 9:15 AM's 1min candle</li>
    <li>volume(W,d,-1) : volume on 20-Aug-2021 in daily chart</li>
    <li>volume(M,W,0) : volume on 2-Aug-2021 in weekly chart</li>
    <li>volume(h,W,-1) : volume on 9-Aug-2021 in weekly chart</li>
    <li>volume(h,1m,5) : volume of 12:20 PM's 1min candle</li>
    <li>volume(30m,15m,-1) : volume of 11:45 AM's 15min candle</li>
