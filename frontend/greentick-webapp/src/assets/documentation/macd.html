<p>macd : syntax : macd(Fast_ema_period,slow_ema_period,signa_line_ema_period,[OLHCV]) : Calculates the macd line for
    given fast ema period and slow ema period for 'close' values (by default).
    User can also calcuate macd for any of OLHCV values.</p>

<p> Note: All indicators should be used after "candle" function.</p>

<p>3 options are available to work with macd indicator.</p>
<ul>
    <li>collect(50) : collectes macd line for last 50 period from user specified reference</li>
    <li>stream(50) : calculates macd signal line for last 50 period from user specified reference</li>
    <li>valueAt(0) : Gives value of macd line at user specified reference</li>
</ul>

    Lets Assume that the current date is 24-Aug-2021, time 12:23 PM. Market started at 9:15 AM and ends at 3:30 PM
    <li>candle(m,5m,0).macd(9,20,10).valueAt(0) > 100 : This means,
        <ul>
            <li>"candle(m,5m,0)" : Starting point "m" = 12:23PM, "5m" = Open 5min chart, "0" = Get the Latest OLHCV
                values in 5min chart, i.e all OLHCV values of 12:15 PM's 5 min candle.</li>
            <li>"macd(9,20,10)" : calculates the value of "macd line" for 9 ema and 20 ema period at 12:15 PM's candle.
            </li>
            <li>"valueAt(0) : Gives the value of "macd line" at latest completed 15min candle, i.e at 12:15 PM candle.
            </li>
        </ul>
        This code check if the macd line's value at 12:15 PM is greater than 100 or not.
    </li>
    <li>candle(m,15m,0).macd(12,26,10).collect(100).sma(12).valueAt(0) > 100
        <ul>
            <li>"candle(m,5m,0)" : Starting point "m" = 12:23PM, "5m" = Open 5min chart, "0" = Get the Latest OLHCV
                values in 5min chart, i.e all OLHCV values of 12:15 PM's 5 min candle.</li>
            <li>"macd(9,20,10)" : calculate the value of "macd line" for 9 ema and 20 ema period at 12:15 PM's candle.
            </li>
            <li>"collect(100)" : collectes macd line values for last 100 period from 12:15 PM.</li>
            <li>"sma(12)" : For collect 100 value in step "c", sma(12) will calculates the 12 period sma.</li>
            <li>"valueAt" : Gives the value of 12 period sma of last 100 period macd line at 12:15 PM.</li>
        </ul>
        This code will check if the 12 period sma of last 100 collected macd line values at 12:15 PM is greater than 100
        or not.
    </li>
    <li>candle(m,15m,0).macd(9,20,10).stream(100).crossover(0,BULLISH) = 1 : This means,
        <ul>
            <li>"candle(m,5m,0)" : Starting point "m" = 12:23PM, "5m" = Open 5min chart, "0" = Get the Latest OLHCV
                values in 5min chart, i.e all OLHCV values of 12:15 PM's 5 min candle.</li>
            <li>"macd(9,20,9)" : calculates the value of "macd line" for 9 ema and 20 ema period at 12:15 PM's candle.
            </li>
            <li>"stream(100)": using macd line, stream will calculate macd signal line for last 100 period. So, this
                will have 100 macd signal values.</li>
            <li>"crossover(0,BULLISH)" : For collected macd line and macd signal line, at 12:15 PM, this will check if
                macd signal line has made "BULLISH" crossover or not. "1" means crossover has happend and "0" means its
                not crossed. Similarly, for BEARISH crossover can also be checked.</li>
        </ul>
        This code will check if at latest closed candle, a BULLISH crossover of macd line and macd signal line has
        occured or not.
    </li>
</ol>
