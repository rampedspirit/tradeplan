    <li>body(m,5m,0) : Starting point "m" = 12:23PM, "5m" = Open 5min chart, "0" = Get the Latest body value in 5min
        chart, i.e body value of 12:15 PM 5 min candle.</li>
    <li>body(m,5m,-1) : Starting point "m" = 12:23PM, Timeframe/chart = 5m, "-1" = 2nd completly closed candle BEFORE
        12:23PM, i.e Latest closed candle = "0" = 12:15PM candle, one before this candle = "-1" = 12:10 PM candle, So
        body value of 12:10 PM candle.</li>
